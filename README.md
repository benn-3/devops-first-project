# DevOps First Project: Complete Observability System

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Complete Observability System** using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.  
It provides monitoring of application metrics and visualization through dashboards, forming the foundation for a full observability stack.

This is my **first DevOps project**, showcasing containerization, monitoring, and dashboard setup.

## üéØ Objective
- Set up a **metrics collection system** using Prometheus.
- Visualize metrics and system performance using Grafana dashboards.
- Prepare the system for integration with logs (Loki) and tracing (Jaeger) for a full observability stack.
